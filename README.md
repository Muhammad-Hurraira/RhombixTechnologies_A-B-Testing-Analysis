# A/B Testing Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of A/B testing data to evaluate the effectiveness of a website change. The goal is to determine whether the new page (treatment group) leads to a statistically significant improvement in user behavior compared to the old page (control group).

---

## 📊 Project Overview

A/B testing is a fundamental technique in data-driven decision-making, particularly in product development, marketing, and UX design. This notebook walks through the process of performing an A/B test using Python, including:

- Data loading and inspection  
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Hypothesis formulation  
- Statistical testing using z-tests  
- Interpretation of results

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### Data Import & Cleaning

- Load the dataset from a CSV file.  
- Identify and remove duplicate or inconsistent entries.  
- Ensure alignment between group assignments and landing pages.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Understand the distribution of users in control vs. treatment groups.  
- Examine conversion rates across groups.  
- Visualize user behavior with charts and plots.  

### Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Conversion rates for the control and treatment groups are the same.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Conversion rates are different.  
- Conduct a two-proportion z-test to compare conversion rates.  

### Statistical Significance

- Use p-values and confidence intervals to assess statistical significance.  
- Discuss Type I and Type II errors in the context of the test.

---

## 📈 Results

The test results indicate whether the observed difference in conversion rates between the two groups is likely due to chance or if it’s statistically significant. Based on the p-value, a final recommendation is made to **keep the old page**.
